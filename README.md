# TrimerizedMottInsulatorMC
Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing behavior of Trimerized Mott Insulator

## Classical Heisenberg Model (3-vector model)

Simulation results for 1 spin periodic boundary lattice under external field match the analytical results.

Not yet verified on lattice with 2 or more spins; but compatibility is believed to hold for larger lattice because the affect of interaction with neighboring spins is in fact involved and verified in 1 spin simulation.
